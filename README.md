# WSPRHATZERO

This is the schematics and PCB design for a small (Pi Zero) format Pi Hat that can transmit WSPR.

Designed to use the [QRP Labs](https://www.qrp-labs.com/lpfkit.html) Low Pass Filter kits to allow for interchangable drop in boards for different bands.

You should hold an appropriate Amateur Radio License and be aware of the legalities of the band/frequency transmission rules for your region before using this board.

## Software

The defaults from [Wsprry Pi](https://wsprry-pi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) should work with this project.

Pin settings:
* LED - GPIO18
* Power - GPIO19

## BOM Ordering

There is a [Mouser compatible BOM](./Mouser%20BOM.xls) included in this repository.
